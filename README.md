My first simple 2D platformer in Unity, during the creation of which, I became acquainted with UI elements, animations, 
specific mechanics (the ability to jump off walls) and the primitive artificial intelligence of enemies (chasing the player) in Unity. 
I suggest you watch the video "gameplay.mp4" to dive into the project.
